Even though Hulu never explains its recommendation algorithms directly, you can figure out a lot from the interface and how it reacts to your watch history."

        "# **How Hulu’s Recommendations Work (Reverse Engineering)**\n",
        "\n",
        "Hulu seems to use a mix of watch behavior, content metadata, and popularity trends to decide what shows and movies to push to each user. A few things become pretty obvious once you use the platform:\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. Viewing history drives most of the recommendations**\n",
        "\n",
        "If you binge a certain type of show (like sitcoms or reality TV), you’ll notice Hulu pushes similar titles across multiple rows. “Because You Watched” shows up often, which means Hulu is linking shows based on shared genres, tone, cast, or themes.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Popular content still gets boosted**\n",
        "\n",
        "Even with personalization, you always see “Trending Now,” “Most Popular,” or “Hulu Picks.” This suggests they use a hybrid approach part personalized, part platform-wide popularity.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Hulu Originals get special treatment**\n",
        "\n",
        "Shows like The Bear, Only Murders in the Building, etc., almost always appear near the top. That’s a business signal to push certain shows.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. Your watch habits matter more than your likes/dislikes**\n",
        "\n",
        "Hulu doesn’t really ask for thumbs up/down the way Netflix does. You can add things to My Stuff, but that’s pretty much the only explicit input. Most of the personalization is coming from implicit signals like:\n",
        "\n",
        "What you clicked\n",
        "\n",
        "How long you watched\n",
        "\n",
        "What you binged\n",
        "\n",
        "What you dropped after 2 minutes\n",
        "\n",
        "When you watched (time of day might affect suggestions)\n",
        "\n",
        "**5. Episode continuation is a priority**\n",
        "\n",
        "“Continue Watching” is always the first row, which shows the system prioritizes session based recommendations basically: “you left off here, so let’s make it easy to return.”\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "So overall, it looks like Hulu uses a hybrid recommender system made up of:\n",

        "Collaborative filtering (similar users watched this)\n",
        "\n",
